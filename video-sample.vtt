00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.159
We've been deployed to the North
Peace Complex and we're working

2
00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:07.191
out of Fort Nelson. Hi,
my name is Hugh Murdoch and I'm

3
00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:10.169
an incident commander on one of
the provinces incident

4
00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.093
management teams. There's a
tremendous amount of fire

5
00:00:13.093 --> 00:00:16.180
burning up in this region right
now. There's roughly 250,

6
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.537
000 hectares burning just within
our complex. The Parker Lake

7
00:00:19.537 --> 00:00:22.786
fire is the one fire that's
garnering the most attention at

8
00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:25.926
this time. That's about 12,
000 hectares in size. That the

9
00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:29.283
fire just to the north of that
as well, the Petrie Creek fire,

10
00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:30.870
much bigger, it's about 65,

11
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.993
1000 hectares. Between those two
fires,

12
00:00:32.993 --> 00:00:36.206
we've got 130 firefighters. I've
made-up of various crews,

13
00:00:36.206 --> 00:00:38.983
there's contract crews,
initial attack unit crews,

14
00:00:38.983 --> 00:00:42.141
we've got local equipment
operators. So there's about 11

15
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:45.244
pieces of heavy equipment,
19 helicopters supporting the

16
00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:47.422
efforts. And you know,
not surprisingly,

17
00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:50.798
the efforts are focused on that
part of the fire that that's

18
00:00:50.798 --> 00:00:53.848
closest to the town of Fort
Nelson. But there's efforts

19
00:00:53.848 --> 00:00:57.332
going on around the perimeter of
both those fires with a longer

20
00:00:57.332 --> 00:01:00.763
term vision of of getting full
suppression on these fires. The

21
00:01:00.763 --> 00:01:01.180
summer

22
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.212
is going to be a long one. I
think it's had an early start

23
00:01:04.212 --> 00:01:06.988
again. And there seems to be
just so much fire on the

24
00:01:06.988 --> 00:01:10.277
landscape so early. And it's not
just lightning that's going to

25
00:01:10.277 --> 00:01:12.847
give us our starts,
but these holdover fires from

26
00:01:12.847 --> 00:01:15.726
previous year. Another source
that's giving us a lot of

27
00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:17.627
challenges. My name is Erica
Fetzima,

28
00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:20.763
fire behavior analyst here at
the North Peace Complex. Over

29
00:01:20.763 --> 00:01:23.487
the next couple of days,
we're expecting some highly

30
00:01:23.487 --> 00:01:25.903
variable fire,
fire conditions. So we're going

31
00:01:25.903 --> 00:01:27.907
to have some places that will
get rain,

32
00:01:27.907 --> 00:01:30.477
others will stay dry. In the
areas that stay dry,

33
00:01:30.477 --> 00:01:32.020
we're expecting to see

34
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.058
some some trees beginning to
candle,

35
00:01:34.058 --> 00:01:36.039
some fairly vigorous surface
fire,

36
00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.776
showing that the fire still has
lots of potential with the rain.

37
00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:43.343
We're going to see many areas
with very subdued fire behaviour

38
00:01:43.343 --> 00:01:46.853
and as our trees start to green
up and grassroots to green up,

39
00:01:46.853 --> 00:01:50.137
that's aiding the fire and sort
of slowing down. However,

40
00:01:50.137 --> 00:01:53.421
we're still in very severe
drought in this area and it's

41
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:56.761
causing really significant
challenges to our firefighters.

42
00:01:56.761 --> 00:02:00.102
You can see behind me that
what's happening is having lots

43
00:02:00.102 --> 00:02:02,550
of trees come down because of
the drought.

44
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04,370
So the fire is burning the roots
out,

45
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.569
trees are falling down and this
is making it very difficult and

46
00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.670
time consuming for our crews to
mop up. So the fire is getting

47
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.672
under these trees. We have to
clear them to put the fire out

48
00:02:13.672 --> 00:02:16.560
and it's taking a lot of time
and effort.

49
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.095
My name is Brett Soderholm and I
am a fire weather forecaster for

50
00:02:20.095 --> 00:02:23.362
the Prince George Fire Centre.
Today I'm actually on site at

51
00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:26.843
the North Peace Complex and the
weather of course up here in the

52
00:02:26.843 --> 00:02:30.004
north is extremely variable from
one day to the next. This

53
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:33.030
morning, for example,
serving off, very cool and humid,

54
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34,852
but now just a couple of hours
later,

55
00:02:34.852 --> 00:02:37.808
the sun has come out. It's
really quite hot and quite dry.

56
00:02:37.808 --> 00:02:40.616
The concern for these next
couple of days is going to be

57
00:02:40.616 --> 00:02:43.769
for the chance of thunderstorms
developing in the area. There's

58
00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.724
a lot of instability in the
atmosphere and the concern from

59
00:02:46.724 --> 00:02:49.877
a wildfire perspective is that
these thunderstorms may generate

60
00:02:49.877 --> 00:02:52.833
some lightning in addition to
some gusty winds. Since early

61
00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:54.360
April,
we've been dealing with

62
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.168
anomalously dry conditions
across parts of the northeast,

63
00:02:57.168 --> 00:03:00.321
and these conditions are still
expected to continue over these

64
00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:02.340
next couple of days. In addition
to that,

65
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.500
we'd be looking for an increase
in winds,

66
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.415
especially toward mid next week.
There's a chance here that we

67
00:03:07.415 --> 00:03:09.868
might get some gusty
northwesterly winds coming down

68
00:03:09.868 --> 00:03:11.190
from the territories.

69
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.916
Yeah,
we all appreciate that the folks

70
00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:15.793
from Fort Nelson have been away
from their homes for some period

71
00:03:15.793 --> 00:03:18.272
of time and that's not a
situation that anyone wants to

72
00:03:18.272 --> 00:03:21.016
be in. We're eager to have them
back. It's nice to have their

73
00:03:21.016 --> 00:03:23.672
support. We've had it from a
distance and it'll be great to

74
00:03:23.672 --> 00:03:26.195
to be more in their company and
be able to interact more

75
00:03:26.195 --> 00:03:28.807
throughout the community with
them as well. It's it's been

76
00:03:28.807 --> 00:03:31.595
good working with some of the
local ground crews and equipment

77
00:03:31.595 --> 00:03:33.853
operators. But yeah,
it'll be nice just to see the

78
00:03:33.853 --> 00:03:34.650
residents as well.
